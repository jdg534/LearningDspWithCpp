# LearningDspWithCpp
For learning Digital Signal Processing, this will be C++ based and should reflect progress on a Udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/cplusplus-digital-signal-processing-dsp/

Unlike the course I'll be using CMake to generate IDE files where needed, this will mainly be for Visual Studio.


you'll need to download and install GNU plot and may have to add the installation directory to PATH depending on
CMake's find_package(Gnuplot) dependencies for your platform.
